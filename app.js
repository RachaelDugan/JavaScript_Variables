console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName} loves ${language}! 
It has been around since ${createdYear} and created by ${author}. 
You can buy his book called ${title} for the low price of ${price}. 
I heard it was on sale but that was ${isOnSale} since there is only ${stock} copies available. 
But, it will be ${salePercentage}% when it does go on sale. 
It's only ${pageCount} pages but has lots of info. They say that ${language} is case 
sensitive and that turns out to be ${isCaseSensitive}! I think you can find that around 
page ${bookMark}`);
